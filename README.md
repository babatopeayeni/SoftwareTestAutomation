#  Software Testing and Quality Assurance   

## Overview
This repository contains key artifacts from **Project One** and **Project Two** for software testing, automation, and quality assurance. These artifacts demonstrate my ability to **develop unit tests, apply testing strategies, and ensure software functionality**.

## Included Files

### **Project One - Contact Service**
- `Contact.java` - Defines the **Contact class** with validation rules.
- `ContactService.java` - Implements **CRUD operations** for managing contacts.
- `ContactTest.java` - Unit tests for **Contact class validation**.
- `ContactServiceTest.java` - Unit tests for **ContactService functionalities**.

### **Project Two - Summary and Reflections**
- `Summary and Reflections Report.pdf` - Discusses **key software testing approaches** and **insights gained**.

## Reflection Questions and Answers

### **How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
Ensuring functionality involves implementing **unit tests** and **integration tests** to verify that each component behaves as expected.  
- In this project, I used **JUnit** to create tests for `Contact.java` and `ContactService.java`, catching issues before deployment.  
- **Security measures** include validating user input, preventing null values, and restricting data modifications with **controlled access methods**.  
- Additionally, **exception handling** prevents system crashes by gracefully managing unexpected conditions.

### **How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
Understanding user needs requires a **clear analysis of requirements** before implementation.  
- In this project, I followed a **requirement-driven development approach**, ensuring that `ContactService` met user expectations for **adding, updating, and deleting contacts**.  
- The **unit tests validate these functionalities**, ensuring they align with user expectations and meet functional requirements.

### **How do I approach designing software?**
I take a **modular approach** to software design by separating concerns into distinct layers:

1. **Model Layer (`Contact.java`)** – Defines the **data structure** and **validation rules**.  
2. **Service Layer (`ContactService.java`)** – Manages **business logic** and **CRUD operations**.  
3. **Testing Layer (JUnit Tests)** – Ensures software **correctness** through **automated testing**.

This structured design makes the program **scalable, maintainable, and testable**.

## Key Takeaways
✔ Implemented **automated testing** with JUnit to validate business logic and error handling.  
✔ Ensured **data integrity and security** through input validation and exception handling.  
✔ Followed **modular software design** for better **maintainability and scalability**.  

This project showcases my ability to **develop reliable and test-driven Java applications** while maintaining **high code quality and security standards**.
